Ethical, social money with the Roll API.

### Intro

Today the world needs to boost bartering, consume less, promote human interaction as well as civil rights, and eliminate global slavery too.

Capitalism as we know it, can dramatically change in the next few years because of COVID or climate disruption.

But what about traditional banking in the midst of a chaos? If you're not too clear about that, let's just imagine how a better world can be.

### About ETHIC

ETHIC is a solidarity currency operating in the digital landscape.

The value of ETHIC resides in ethics. The aim of it is to provide a sustainable alternative to traditional money controlled by third parties such as central banks or the global freelance platforms market, just to name a few.

ETHIC is also a karmic, trust indicator behaving as a powerful attractor rather than any other thing. Also, as opposed to other currencies, the purpose of ETHIC is simply usage. It doesn't actually make any sense to accumulate or invest ETHIC.

> If you're an ETHIC user, let's just work together!

### Embedding ETHIC Payments Into Websites

Can you imagine? It is all about tuning with the forces in the universe that'll provide you with what you actually deserve, and vice versa.

Imagine is an embeddable code snippet written in PHP that demonstrates how to transfer ethical trust through social money and the [Roll API](https://docs.tryroll.com/) when paying for goods and services. Since PHP is widely used on the Internet the snippet can be easily revamped into multiple CMS and frameworks.

### Proof of Concept

Let's say Bob is a "software developer" using the freelancing platform Acme for a living on a regular basis.

All of a sudden he needs to be an "employer" on the Acme platform for the first time and use the services of Alice, who is a CSS designer. The problem is Acme users (Alice) can't see any previous feedback indicator (stars) on how ethical Bob is as an employer.

> Here is where ETHIC comes to the rescue!

When the work is being accepted, Alice gets an HTML popup informing that Bob is an awesome human being, a regular user of ETHIC, so finally decides to accept the job.

Finally, once the task is completed, Bob might want to get some ETHIC from a 100.00 USD transaction with Alice, in which case he'll ask Alice, if she's okay with that, to please transfer 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 ETHIC.

> 1 ETHIC = 1 milligram of gold.

In a nutshell, this is nothing but a rating system in the form of an ETHIC transaction from Alice to Bob.

### Development
