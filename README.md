# Imagine

Today the world needs to boost bartering, promote human interaction as well as civil rights, and eliminate global slavery too. Capitalism, as we know it today, will dramatically change in the next few years because of climate disruption. But can traditional banking save you in the midst of a chaos?

If you're not too clear about that, let's just imagine how a better world can be.

Imagine is a code snippet that developers can embed in apps and web sites for users to pay, get paid, or reward anyone with $E for their ethical actions. $E is a solidarity currency operating in the digital landscape which stands for ethics.

The aim of it is to provide a sustainable alternative to traditional money controlled by third parties such as central banks or the global Freelance Platforms market, just to name a few.

The value of $E resides in ethics. At this stage, $E is possibly more of a karmic indicator behaving as a powerful attractor rather than any other thing.

Can you imagine? This is tuning with the forces in the universe that'll provide you with what you actually deserve!
